# SplitTheBill
First app on R Shiny

Hi, 
SplitTheBill is my first app created on R shiny. It is an expense sharing application that helps users split expenses and debts with friends and roommates.
It allows to keeps balances as in who owes how much to whom and it generates the optimal way of repayments.
This is indeed one of the best ways to ensure the repayment of one's debtsand is useful for travel, house sharing, shopping, etc.

Have fun with it!
Simon
