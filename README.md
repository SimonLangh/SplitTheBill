# SplitTheBill
First app on R Shiny

Hi, 
SplitTheBill is my first web app created on R shiny. It is an expense sharing application that helps users split expenses and debts with friends or roommates.
It allows to keeps balances as in who owes how much to whom and it generates the optimal way of repayments.
This is the best way to ensure the repayment of one's debts and is useful for travel, house sharing, shopping, etc.

Have fun with it!
Simon
